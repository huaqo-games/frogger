# Frogger

## Overview
This Frogger game is built using the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) library, which is ideal for creating 2D games in Python.

## Prerequisites
To run the game, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.13 or later**: Install the latest version of Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).
- **Pygame**: The game relies on Pygame for graphical rendering, input handling, and sound.

## Setting Up the Environment
Follow these steps to set up the game environment:

1. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
   This will create a virtual environment in the `venv` directory.

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   On macOS or Linux:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   On Windows:
   ```cmd
   venv\Scriptsctivate
   ```

3. **Install Pygame:**
   With the virtual environment activated, install Pygame:
   ```bash
   pip3 install pygame
   ```

## Running the Game
To start the game, activate the virtual environment and run the following command:

```bash
python3 code/main.py
```

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure the virtual environment is activated before running the game or installing dependencies.
- If you encounter issues with Pygame installation, confirm your Python version is compatible with the latest Pygame release.
- Verify that all necessary game files, including `code/main.py`, are in the correct directory.
